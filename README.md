# Push_swap

## Summary
This project involves sorting data on a stack using a limited set of instructions, with the objective of achieving the lowest possible number of actions. It requires the manipulation of various algorithms and the selection of the most suitable solution for optimized data sorting.

## Chapter I: Foreword
- Provides code examples in different programming languages such as C, ASM, LOLCODE, PHP, BrainFuck, C#, HTML5, YASL, and OCaml.

## Chapter II: Introduction
- Introduces the Push swap project, which involves sorting data using a stack and a set of instructions.
- Describes the goal of the project, which is to write a program that calculates and displays the smallest program, consisting of Push swap language instructions, to sort the given integers.

## Chapter III: Objectives
- Explains the learning objectives of the project, including rigor, the use of C, and the understanding of basic algorithms and their complexity.
- Emphasizes the importance of sorting algorithms in a developer's journey and job interviews.

## Chapter IV: Common Instructions
- Provides a set of common instructions for the project, including the use of C, adherence to the Norm, handling errors, memory management, Makefile requirements, and the use of a separate libft library if permitted.

## Chapter V: Mandatory Part
### V.1 The rules
- Describes the rules of the project, including the initial stack configuration, available operations (sa, sb, ss, pa, pb, ra, rb, rr, rra, rrb, rrr), and the goal of sorting the stack in ascending order.

### V.2 Example
- Provides an example to illustrate the effect of some instructions on sorting a random list of integers.

### V.3 The "push_swap" program
- Describes the requirements for the "push_swap" program, including the Makefile, arguments, external functions, and the expected output format.
- Specifies that the program should display the smallest list of instructions possible to sort the stack, and it should handle errors appropriately.

## Chapter VI: Bonus Part
### VI.1 The "checker" program
- Describes the requirements for the "checker" program, including the Makefile, arguments, external functions, and the expected output format.
- Specifies that the program should execute the provided instructions on the stack and display "OK" if the stack is sorted and empty at the end, or "KO" otherwise.
- Emphasizes the need to handle errors properly.

## Chapter VII: Submission and peer-evaluation
- Provides instructions for submitting the assignment through a Git repository and mentions that only the work inside the repository will be evaluated.
- Mentions that the bonus part will only be assessed if the mandatory part is perfect.
